The Jungle Book Mowgli story is a story of a young boy who has been raised by wolves in the Jungle, since his childhood. The wolf family raised the baby as their own. The young boy Mowgli learned to take care of himself in the jungle, but his friend the black panther “Bagheera” was always nearby.  He was always prepared to protect the young boy, Mowgli. The Mowgli became part of the wolf pack, and Baloo, the old bear, and Bagheera, the black panther, taught him the law of the jungle. Mowgli’s most dangerous enemy in the jungle was Sher Khan. He was the man-eating tiger in the jungle and wanted to kill the man-cub “Mowgli” before he had a chance to become a man living in the jungle.
